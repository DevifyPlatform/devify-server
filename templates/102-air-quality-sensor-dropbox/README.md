The use scenario of this project.

* Save hardware data to Dropbox files
* The name of each file is according to the current timestamp

This project shows how to extend devify-server biolerplate to save data to Dropbox files. Please read [Devify](https://github.com/DevifyPlatform/devify-server/blob/master/README.md) to understand Devify in a bit before continue to this project.

## Quickstart

The steps are the same with the previous 3 project. I will explain this project in a short.

1. This project uses Dropbox APIs. Please signup and get your own application key at [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/).

2. Please copy ```config.app.json.example``` to ```config.app.json```.

3. Please copy ```config.access_token.json.example``` to ```config.access_token.json```.

4. Please modify ```config.app.json``` and ```config.access_token.json``` to fill with your Dropbox token and secret key.

It's time to go to Level 2.

## Next

* To be continued.
