A little book for beginners to get started with IoT cloud servers. This little book is a side project of [*devify-server*](https://github.com/DevifyPlatform/devify-server) which is a simple IoT server boilerplate.

**Devify** is extremely light weight, and is very easy to use. It aims to help developers to create IoT application servers, faster.

There are five templates (with one chapter for each template) developed by this book to introduce the usage of *devify-server* open source project.

## Who should read

* People who are interested in using ESP8266 for developing IoT devices, and
* Want to develop IoT cloud servers to connect their devices over the web.
